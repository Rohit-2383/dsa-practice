# 🧠 DSA Practice – Daily Problem Solving

This repository contains my **daily practice/revision of Data Structures & Algorithms (DSA)**  across platforms like LeetCode, NeetCode and more ... in future.

---

## 📚 Structure

- 📁 `NeetCode/`: Categorized by topic (e.g., Arrays, Strings)
- 📁 `LeetCode/`: Categorized by topic (e.g., Arrays, Strings)
- 📁 `Notes/`: My personal notes for quick revision

---

## 🚀 Goals

- Solve **1–3 problems, take notes or implement the algorithm in code  daily to reinforce understanding**
- Refining my understanding of data structures and algorithms through consistent, hands-on coding practice
- Cover all major topics 
- Focus on both **coding** and **understanding**
